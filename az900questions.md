# 1\. Which of the following is a correct statement?

7:59

c)

a) Private cloud = Public cloud + Hybrid cloud

b) Public Cloud= Hybrid cloud+ Private cloud

***c) Hybrid cloud = Private cloud + Public Cloud***

Explanation

### Public cloud

Public cloud are owned and operated by cloud service providers like Azure, AWS, GCP.

Public clouds are most common type of cloud computing deployment where the cloud resources (like servers and storage) are owned and operated by a 3rd party cloud service provider and delivered over the Internet.

Public cloud, all hardware, software, and other supporting infrastructure are owned and managed by the cloud provider microsoft is an example of the public cloud.

In a public cloud, you share the same hardware, storage, and network devices with other organisations or cloud "tenants," and you access services and manage your account using a web browser.

Public cloud deployments are frequently used to provide web based email online office applications storage and testing and development environments.

Advantage of public clouds:

* lower cost - no need to purchase hardware or software and you pay only for the service you use.
    
* No maintenance - your service provider provides the maintenance.
    
*  unlimited scalability - on-demand resources are available to meet your business needs.
    
* High reliability - a vast network of servers ensures against failure.
    

### Private cloud

Private cloud is where the computing resources/ cloud resources are offered Exclusively via a private network.

Definition :

Private cloud consists of cloud computing resources used exclusively by one business or organization.

The private cloud can be physically located at your organization's onsite data center, Or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider.

but in a private cloud, the services and infrastructure are always maintained on a private network and the hardware and software are dedicated solely to your organization.

Private clouds are often used by government agencies, financial institutions and other mid-to-large-size organizations with business-critical operations seeking enhanced control over their environment.

Advantages of a private cloud:

* More flexibility - Your organization can customize Its cloud environment to meet specific business needs.
    
* More control - resources are not shared with others, so higher levels of control and privacy are possible.
    
* More scalability - Private clouds often offer more scalability compared to on-premises infrastructure.
    

### Hybrid cloud

A hybrid cloud, As the name suggests, is a combination of public cloud and private cloud. A hybrid cloud typically extends a connection from an on-premises data center to a public cloud.

A hybrid cloud is a type of cloud computing that combines on premises infrastructure - or a private cloud - with a public cloud. Hybrid clouds allow data and apps to move between the two environments.

Many organisations choose a hybrid cloud approach due to business imperative such as

* meeting regulatory and data sovereignty requirements,
    
* taking full advantage of on premises technology investment,
    
* or addressing low latency issues
    

The hybrid cloud is evolving to include edge workloads as well. Add computing brings the computing power of the cloud to IOT devices - closer to where the data resides.

By moving workloads to the edge, devices spend less time communicating with the cloud, reducing latency and they are even able to operate reliably in extended offline periods.

When computing and processing demand fluctuates, hybrid cloud computing gives businesses the ability to seamlessly scale up their on premises infrastructure to the public cloud to handle any overflow - without giving the third-party data centres access to the entirety of the data.

Advantages of hybrid cloud:

* Control- your organisation can maintain a private infrastructure for sensitive assets or workloads that require low latency.
    
* Flexibility - you can take advantage of additional resources in the public cloud when you need them.
    
* Cost - effectiveness - with ability to scale to the public cloud, you pay for extra computing power only when needed.
    
* Ease - transitioning to the hybrid cloud doesn't have to be overwhelming because you can migrate gradually phasing in workloads over time.

## 2\. Which of the following describes the benefit of cloud services?

12:09

a)

***a) Economies of scale***

b) fixed workloads

c) unpredictable costs

Economics of scale is the ability to do things more cheaply and more efficiently when operating at a larger scale in comparison to operating at smaller scale.

## 3\. When you implement a SAAS (software as a service) solution your responsible for?

@13:23

c)

a) Installing Patches on operating systems

b) Configure high availability

***c) Configure the SAAS solution***

d) Instal SASS solution

An example would be an email services like Gmail Outlook where you configure it according to your needs.

## 4\. Which of the following refers to spending money upfront and then deducting that expense over time?

15:53

a)

***a) capital expenditure - CapEx***

b) Operation expenditure - OpEx

c) supply and demand

<details> 
<summary>
Explanation
</summary>

| Capital expenditure | operation expenditure |
| --- | --- |
| CapEx (Capital expenditure) is the spending of money on physical infrastructure upfront and then deducting that expense from your tax bill overtime. | OpEx (Operation expenditures) is spending money on services or products now on being built for them now. You can deduct this expense from your tax bill in the same year. |
| CapEx Is an upfront cost which has a value that reduces overtime and usually has more recurring cost. | There is no upfront cost that has recurrent cost. |
| Capital expenditure (CapEx) are major purchases a company makes that are designed to be used over the long term. | Operation expenditures (OpEx) are the *day-to-day expenses* a company incurs to keep its business operational. |
| Examples of CapEx include Physical assets such as buildings equipment machinery and vehicles. | Examples of OpEx include employee salaries, rent, utilities, property taxes, and cost of goods sold (COGS) |
| Deploying your own data centre and ***<mark> Azure Reserved VM Instances </mark>*** are a few examples of CapEx pricing model. | ***<mark>Azure Virtual machines are an example of OpEx pricing model.</mark>*** |

***<mark>Microsoft azure reserve vm instances in cloud or an example of CapEx pricing model.</mark>***

***<mark>Azure Virtual machines are an example of OpEx pricing model.</mark>***

## 5\. From the choices below, what is one of the advantages of moving your infrastructure to Azure?

19:08

a)

***a) The move reduces capital expenditures (CapEx)***

b) The move reduces operational expenses (OpEx)

c) The move allows for complete control of infrastructure resources.
